I'm a CPA who interested in programming.

This blog is built to document my learning progress and share the things which might be useful as well.

I am a slow walker, but I'm moving forward step by step. 

I know I can't be everthing to everyone, however, I can be something to someone ... even a lot of someones.

**Does the blog deserve a star?**
