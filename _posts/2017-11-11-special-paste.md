**This macro has two functions:** <br>
One called ``SpecialPaste_Value`` can convert your selected area into values, and the other called ``PasteSpecial`` can be used when you want to copy client's PBCs to your working papers and keep its format at the same time. With the customized special pasting add-in, you could paste the data with its original values, column widths and formats.
